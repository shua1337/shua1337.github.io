  <p>Set in the not too distant future, this story is told by a Catholic Priest who also happens to be a woman—as the Catholic Church has recently had difficulty attracting qualified men. Her full name is Isobel Alexandria Wayland, but she is known as “Alex” by her friends, and as “Mother Alex” in her priestly role as head of St. Luke’s Catholic Church in Louisville, Kentucky. A highly unusual woman, she is tall, lean, and beautiful—with fiery red hair. She also has a no-nonsense attitude, can be distinctly irreverent at times, and secretly has difficulty suppressing her sexual desire for handsome men. What’s most unusual about her, however, is that she sees monsters. Alex sees the dark, hidden monster that emerges in the people around her. This secret shadow creature is Scylla, a supernatural serpent like monster from Greek mythology with six long scaled necks that hold ferocious dragon heads.</p><br>
  <p>Mother Alex, her friend, Tony, a handsome transplant from Scotland, and her lovely Mexican-American colleague and priest-in-training, Maria, encounter and eventually must battle a group of evil white supremacists who have formed a unit of the Klu Klux Klan. Unknown to the police, this group is terrorizing the minority community of Louisville and has set its sights on raping and then murdering Alex and Maria.</p><br>
